            <h2>Processing Fee Absorption Policy</h2>
            <p>
              Participating companies have the option to absorb the KickPost
              service and processing fees associated with incentive and reward
              programs. If a company chooses to absorb these fees, they will be
              billed directly each month for all applicable fees through a
              separate Processing Fee Invoice. These invoices are distinct from
              standard invoices and are subject to the same net 30-day payment
              terms. Companies are responsible for timely payment of these
              invoices to avoid disruption of service.
            </p>
            <h2>Payroll-Based Payouts and Funding Dates</h2>
            <p>
              Companies that elect to distribute payouts via their own internal
              payroll systems are responsible for setting monthly Funding Dates.
              The Funding Date represents the expected payout date and must
              align with their payroll cycle. Companies are solely responsible
              for ensuring that payouts are disbursed to their participants by
              the designated Funding Date. Delays or errors in payroll
              disbursement are the responsibility of the company and not
              KickPost.
            </p>
            <h2>Rewards</h2>
            <p>
              Rewards are payouts earned through training completions or other
              non-sales-based engagement activities. This includes legacy
              bonuses.

              Users acknowledge that any payouts received through the KickPost
              platform may be subject to taxation under applicable federal,
              state, and local laws. KickPost will comply with all tax reporting
              requirements, including but not limited to issuing IRS Form 1099
              or other relevant tax documents to payout recipients as necessary,

            </p>
            <p>
              Participating companies can choose to distribute payouts via their
              payroll system. In these cases the taxation of payouts will be the
              sole responsibility of the associated user's company and its

              obligations or consequences arising from payouts received through

              This may include, but is not limited to, websites, social media,
              press releases, and other advertising mediums. KickPost agrees to
              use Company Identifiers in a manner that accurately represents

              remaining parts will continue in effect. The failure of KickPost
              to enforce any provision will not constitute a waiver. Users agree
              to initiate any claims within one year, or they are permanently
              barred. The Terms are governed by U.S. federal law and Illinois
              state law, and the Company may assign these Terms at any time.
